<p>Peter de Hooch was dreaming that
the moon had blown up when he
awakened. The room was dark except
for the glowing night-light near the
door, and he sat up trying to separate
the dream from reality. He focused
his eyes on the glow-plate. What had
wakened him? Something had, he
was sure, but there didn't seem to be
anything out of the ordinary now.</p>

<p>The explosion in his dream had
seemed extraordinarily realistic. He
could still remember vividly the vibration
and the <i>cr-r-r-ump!</i> of the
noise. But there was no sign of what
might have caused the dream
sequence.</p>

<p>Maybe something fell, he thought.
He swung his legs off his bed and
padded barefoot over to the light
switch. He was so used to walking
under the light lunar gravity that he
was no longer conscious of it. He
pressed the switch, and the room was
suddenly flooded with light. He
looked around.</p>

<p>Everything was in place, apparently.
There was nothing on the floor
that shouldn't be there. The books
were all in their places in the bookshelf.
The stuff on his desk seemed
undisturbed.</p>

<p>The only thing that wasn't as it
should be was the picture on the
wall. It was a reproduction of a painting
by Pieter de Hooch, which he had
always liked, aside from the fact that
he had been named after the seventeenth-century
Dutch artist. The picture
was slightly askew on the wall.</p>

<p>He was sleepily trying to figure out
the significance of that when the
phone sounded. He walked over and
picked it up. "Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Guz? Guz? Get over here quick!"
Sam Willows' voice came excitedly
from the instrument.</p>

<p>"Whatsamatter, Puss?" he asked
blearily.</p>

<p>"Number Two just blew! We need
help, Guz! Fast!"</p>

<p>"I'm on my way!" de Hooch said.</p>

<p>"Take C corridor," Willows
warned. "A and B caved in, and the
bulkheads have dropped. Make it
snappy!"</p>

<p>"I'm gone already," de Hooch said,
dropping the phone back into place.</p>

<p>He grabbed his vacuum suit from
its hanger and got into it as though
his own room had already sprung an
air leak.</p>

<p><i>Number Two has blown!</i> he
thought. That would be the one that
Ferguson and Metty were working
on. What had they been cooking? He
couldn't remember right off the bat.
Something touchy, he thought; something
pretty hot.</p>

<p>But that wouldn't cause an atomic
reactor to blow. It obviously hadn't
been a nuclear blow-up of any proportions,
or he wouldn't be here now,
zipping up the front of his vac suit.
Still, it had been powerful enough to
shake the lunar crust a little or he
wouldn't have been wakened by the
blast.</p>

<p>These new reactors could get out a
lot more power, and they could do a
lot more than the old ones could, but
they weren't as safe as the old heavy-metal
reactors, by a long shot. None
had blown up yet&mdash;quite&mdash;but there
was still the chance. That's why they
were built on Luna instead of on
Earth. Considering what they could
do, de Hooch often felt that it would
be safer if they were built out on
some nice, safe asteroid&mdash;preferably
one in the Jovian Trojan sector.</p>

<p>He clamped his fishbowl on tight,
opened the door, and sprinted toward
Corridor C.</p>

<p>The trouble with the Ditmars-Horst
reactor was that it lacked any
automatic negative-feedback system.
If a D-H decided to go wild, it went
wild. Fortunately, that rarely happened.
The safe limits for reactions
were quite wide&mdash;wider, usually, than
the reaction limits themselves, so that
there was always a margin of safety.
And within the limits, a nicety of
control existed that made nucleonics
almost an esoteric branch of chemistry.
Cookbook chemistry, practically.</p>

<p>Want deuterium? Recipe: To
1.00813 gms. purest Hydrogen-1 add,
slowly and with care, 1.00896
gms. fine-grade neutrons. Cook until
well done in a Ditmars-Horst reactor.
Yield: 2.01471 gms. rare old
deuterium plus some two million million
million ergs of raw energy. Now
you are cooking with gas!</p>

<p>All you had to do was keep the reaction
going at a slow enough rate so
that the energy could be bled off, and
there was nothing to worry about.
Usually. But control of the feebleizer
fields still wasn't perfect, because the
fields that enfeebled the reactions
and made them easy to control weren't
yet too well understood.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Peter de Hooch turned into Corridor
C and kept on running. There
was plenty of air still in this corridor,
and there was apparently little likelihood
of his needing his vac suit. But
on the moon nobody responds to an
emergency call without a vac suit.</p>

<p>He was troubled about Corridors
A and B. The explosion must have
been pretty violent to have sealed off
two of the four corridors leading
from the living quarters to the reaction
labs. Two corridors went directly
to one of the reactors, two went directly
to the second. Two more connected
the reactor labs themselves,
putting the labs and the living quarters
at the corners of an equilateral
triangle. (Peter had never been able
to figure out why A and B corridors
led to Reactor Two, while C and D
led to Reactor One. Logically, he
thought, it should have been the other
way around. Oh, well.)</p>

<p>Going down C meant that he'd
have to get to Reactor Two the long
way around.</p>

<p>What had the damage been? he
asked himself. Had anyone been
hurt? Or killed? He pushed the questions
out of his mind. There was no
point in speculating. He'd have
the information soon enough.</p>

<p>He took the cutoff to the left, at a
sixty-degree angle to Corridor C,
which led him directly to Corridor
E, by-passing Reactor One. He noticed
as he went by that the operations
lamp was out. Nobody was
working with Reactor One.</p>

<p>As he pounded on down the empty
corridor, he suddenly realized that he
hadn't seen anyone else running with
him. There were five other men in
the reactor station, and&mdash;so far&mdash;he
had seen no one. He knew where
Willows was, but where were Ferguson,
Metty, Laynard, and Quillan?
He pushed those questions out of his
mind, too, for the time being.</p>

<p>A head popped out of the door at
the far end of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Guz! <i>Hurry</i>, Guz!"</p>

<p>De Hooch didn't bother to answer
Willows. He was short of breath as it
was. He knew, besides, that no answer
was expected. He had known
Willows for years, and knew how he
thought. It was Willows who had first
tagged de Hooch with that silly nickname,
"Guzzle". Not because Peter
was such a heavy drinker&mdash;although
he could hold it like a gentleman&mdash;but
because he had thought "Guzzle"
de Hooch was so uproariously funny.
"Nobody likes a guzzle as well as de
Hooch," he'd say, with an idiot grin.
As a result, everybody called Peter
"Guz" now.</p>

<p>The head had vanished back into
the control room of Reactor Two. De
Hooch kept on running, his breath
rasping loudly in the confines of the
fishbowl helmet. Running four hundred
yards isn't the easiest thing in
the world, even if a man is in good
physical condition. There was less
weight to contend with, but the mass
that had to be pushed along remained
the same. The notion that running on
Luna was an effortless breeze was one
that only Earthhuggers clung to.</p>

<p>He ran into the control room and
stopped, panting heavily. "What ...
happened?"</p>

<p>Sam Willows' normally handsome
face looked drawn. "Something went
wrong. I don't know what. I was finishing
up with Reactor One when I
heard the explosion. They are both"&mdash;he
gestured toward the reactor&mdash;"both
in there."</p>

<p>"Still alive?"</p>

<p>"I think so. One of 'em, anyway.
Take a look."</p>

<p>De Hooch went over to the periscope
and put his eyes to the binoculars.
He could see two figures in
heavy, dull-gray radiation-proof suits.
They were lying flat on the floor,
and neither was moving. De Hooch
said as much.</p>

<p>"The one on the left was moving
his arm&mdash;just a little," Willows said.
"I'll swear he was."</p>

<p>Something in the man's voice made
de Hooch turn his head away from
the periscope's eyepieces. Willows'
face was gray, and a thin film of
greasy perspiration reflected the light
from the overhead plates. The man
was on the verge of panic.</p>

<p>"Calm down, Puss," de Hooch said
gently. "Where's Quillan and Laynard?"</p>

<p>"They're in their rooms," Willows
said in a tight voice. "Trapped. The
bulkheads have closed 'em off in A.
No air in the corridor. We'll have to
dig 'em out. I called 'em both on the
phone. They're all right, but they're
trapped."</p>

<p>"Did you call Base?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They haven't got a ship.
They sent three moon-cats, though.
They ought to be here by morning."</p>

<p>De Hooch looked up at the chronometer
on the wall. Oh one twelve,
Greenwich time. "Morning" meant
any time between eight and noon;
the position of the sun up on the surface
had nothing to do with Lunar
time. As a matter of fact, there was a
full Earth shining at the moment,
which meant that it wouldn't be dawn
on the surface for a week yet.</p>

<p>"If the cats from Base get here by
noon, we'll be O.K., won't we?" de
Hooch asked.</p>

<p>"Look at the instruments," Willows
said.</p>

<p>De Hooch ran a practiced eye over
the console and swallowed. "What
were they running?"</p>

<p>"Mercury 203," Willows said.
"Half-life forty-six point five days.
Beta and gamma emitter. Converts to
Thallium 203, stable."</p>

<p>"What did they want with a kilogram
of the stuff?"</p>

<p>"Special order. Shipment to Earth
for some reason."</p>

<p>"Have you checked the end-point?
She's building up fast."</p>

<p>"No. No. I haven't." He wet his
lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>

<p>"Check it," said de Hooch. "Do any
of the controls work?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't want to
fiddle with them."</p>

<p>"You start giving them a rundown.
I'm going to get into a suit
and go pull those two out of there&mdash;if
they're still alive." He opened the
locker and took his radiation-proof
suit out. He checked it over carefully
and began shucking his vac suit.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">A few minutes delay in getting to
the men in the reactor's anteroom
didn't matter much. If they hadn't
been killed outright, and were still
alive, they would probably live a
good deal longer. The shells of the
radiation suits didn't look damaged,
and the instruments indicated very
little radiation in the room. Whatever
it was that had exploded had done
most of its damage at the other end
of the reactor. Evidently, a fissure had
been opened to the surface, forty feet
above&mdash;a fissure big enough to let all
the air out of A and B corridors, and
activate the automatic bulkheads to
seal off the airless section.</p>

<p>What troubled him was Willows.
If he hadn't known the man so well,
de Hooch would have verbally blasted
him where he stood.</p>

<p>His reaction to trouble had been
typical. De Hooch had already seen
Willows in trouble three times, and
each time, the reaction had been the
same: near panic. Every time, his first
thought had been to scream for help
rather than to do anything himself.
Almost anyone else would have made
one call and then climbed into a radiation
suit to get Ferguson and Metty
out of the anteroom. There was certainly
no apparent immediate danger.
But all that Willows had done
was yell for someone to come and do
his thinking and acting for him. He
had called Base; he had called de
Hooch; he had called Quillan and
Laynard. But he hadn't done anything
else.</p>

<p>Now he had to be handled with
kid gloves. If de Hooch didn't act
calm, if he didn't go about things just
right, Willows might very likely go
over the line into total panic. As long
as he had someone to depend on, he'd
be all right, and de Hooch didn't
want to lose the only help he had
right now.</p>

<p>"Fermium 256," said Willows in a
tight, flat voice.</p>

<p>"What?" de Hooch asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Fermium 256," Willows repeated.
"That's what the stuff is going to
start building towards. Spontaneous
fission. Half-life of three hours." He
took a deep breath. "The reactor won't
be able to contain it. We haven't got
that kind of bleed-off control."</p>

<p>"No," de Hooch agreed. "I suggest
we stop it."</p>

<p>"The freezer control isn't functioning,"
Willows said. "I guess that's
what they went in there to correct."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," de Hooch said carefully.
"They wouldn't have needed
suits for that. They must have had
something else bothering them. I'd be
willing to bet they went in to pull a
sample and something went wrong."</p>

<p>"Why? What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"If there'd been trouble, they'd
have called for someone to stay here
at the console. Both of them wouldn't
have gone in if there was any trouble."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right."
He looked visibly relieved. "What do
you suppose went wrong?"</p>

<p>"Look at your meters. Four of 'em
aren't registering."</p>

<p>Willows looked. "I hadn't noticed.
I thought they were just registering
low. You're right, though. Yeah.
You're right. The surface bleed-off.
Hydrogen loss. Blew a valve, is all.
Yeah." He grinned a little. "Must've
been quite a volcano for a second or
two."</p>

<p>De Hooch grinned back at him.
"Yeah. Must've. Give me a hand with
these clamps."</p>

<p>Willows began fastening the
clamps on the heavy suit. "D'you
think Ferguson and Metty are O.K.,
Guz?" he asked.</p>

<p>De Hooch noticed it was the first
time he had used the names of the
two men. Now that there was a
chance that they were alive, at least in
his own mind, he was willing to admit
that they were men he knew.
Willows didn't want to think that
anyone he knew had done such a terrible
thing as die. It hit too close to
home.</p>

<p>The man wasn't thinking. He was
willing to grasp at anything that offered
him a chance&mdash;dream straws.
The idea was to keep him busy, keep
his mind on trivia, keep him from
thinking about what was going on inside
that reactor.</p>

<p>He should have known automatically
that it was building toward
Fermium 256. It was the most logical,
easiest, and simplest way for a
D-H reactor to go off the deep end.</p>

<p>A Ditmars-Horst reactor took advantage
of the fact that any number
can be expressed as the sum of powers
of two&mdash;and the number of
nucleons in an atomic nucleus was no
exception to that mathematical rule.</p>

<p>Building atoms by adding nucleons
wasn't as simple as putting marbles in
a bag because of the energy differential,
but the energy derived from the
fusion of the elements lighter than
Iron 56 could be compensated for by
using it to pack the nuclei heavier
than that. The trick was to find
a chain of reactions that gave the
least necessary energy transfer. The
method by which the reactions were
carried out might have driven a mid-Twentieth
Century physicist a trifle
ga-ga, but most of the reactions themselves
would have been recognizable.</p>

<p>There were several possible reactions
which Ferguson and Metty could
have used to produce Hg-203, but de
Hooch was fairly sure he knew which
one it was. The five-branch, double-alpha-addition
scheme was the one
that was easiest to use&mdash;and it was
the only one that started the damnable
doubling chain reaction, where
the nuclear weights went up exponentially
under the influence of the
peculiar conditions within the reactor.
2-4-8-16-32-64-128-256 ...
Hydrogen 2 and Helium 4 were stable.
So were Oxygen 16 and Sulfur
32. The reaction encountered a sticky
spot at Beryllium 8, which is highly
unstable, with a half life of ten to the
minus sixteenth seconds, spontaneously
fissioning back into two Helium
4 nuclei. Past Sulfur 32, there was a
lot of positron emission as the nuclei
fought to increase the number of
neutrons to maintain a stable balance.
Germanium 64 is not at all stable,
and neither is Neodymium 128, but
the instability can be corrected by
positive beta emission. When two
nuclei of the resulting Xenon 128
are forced together, the positron emission
begins long before the coalescence
is complete, resulting in Fermium
256.</p>

<p>But not even a Ditmars-Horst reactor
can stand the next step, because
matter itself won't stand it&mdash;not even
in a D-H reactor. The trouble is that
a D-H reactor <i>tries</i>. Mathematically,
it was assumed that the resulting
nucleus did exist&mdash;for an infinitesimal
instant of time. Literally, mathematically,
infinitesimal&mdash;so close to zero
that it would be utterly impossible to
measure it. Someone had dubbed the
hypothetical stuff Instantanium 512.</p>

<p>Whether Instantanium 512 had any
real existence is an argument for
philosophers only. The results, in any
case, were catastrophic. The whole
conglomeration came apart in a grand
splatter of neutrons, protons, negatrons,
positrons, electrons, neutrinos&mdash;a
whole slew of Greek-lettered
mesons of various charges and masses,
and a fine collection of strange and
ultrastrange particles. Energy? Just
oodles and gobs.</p>

<p>Peter de Hooch had heard about
the results. He had no desire to experience
them first hand. Fortunately,
the reaction that led up to them took
time. It could be stopped at any time
up to the Fm-256 stage. According to
the instruments, that wouldn't be for
another six hours yet, so there was
nothing at all to worry about. Even
after that it could be stopped, provided
one had a way to get rid of the
violently fissioning fermium.</p>

<p>"Connections O.K.?" Willows asked.
His voice came over the earphones inside
the ponderous helmet of the radiation
suit.</p>

<p>"Fine," said de Hooch. He adjusted
the double periscope so that
his vision was clear. "Perfect."</p>

<p>He tested the controls, moving his
arms and legs to see if the suit responded.
The suit was so heavy that,
without powered joints, controlled by
servomechanisms, he would have
been unable to move, even under
Lunar gravity. With the power on,
though, it was no harder than walking
underwater in a diving suit. "All's
well, Puss," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll keep an eye on you," said
Willows.</p>

<p>"Fine. Well, here goes Colossus de
Hooch." He began walking toward
the door that led into the corridor
which connected the reactor anteroom
to the control room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">It took time to drag the two inert
figures out of the anteroom. All de
Hooch could do was grab them under
the armpits, apply power, and drag
them out. He went out the same way
he had come in, traversing the separate
chambers in reverse order. First
came the decontamination chamber,
where the radioactive dust that might
have settled on the suits was sluiced
off by the detergent sprays. When the
radiation detectors registered low
enough, de Hooch dragged Ferguson
into the outer chamber, then went
back and got Metty and put him
through the same process. Then he
dragged them on into the control
room so that Willows could get them
out of the heavy suits.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 616px;">
<img src="images/001.png" width="616" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Can you help me, Guz?" Willows
asked. It was obvious that he didn't
want to open the suits. He didn't
want to see what might be inside. De
Hooch helped him.</p>

<p>They were both alive, but unconscious.
Bones had been broken, and
Metty appeared to be suffering from
concussion. They were badly damaged,
but they'd live.</p>

<p>De Hooch and Willows made two
trips down E and C corridors, carrying
the men on a stretcher, to get them
in bed. De Hooch splinted the broken
bones as best he could and gave each
of them a shot of narcodyne. He had
to do the medical work because Quillan,
the medic, was trapped in Corridor
A. He called Quillan on the
phone to tell him what had happened.
He described the signs and
symptoms of the victims as best he
could, and then did what Quillan told
him to do.</p>

<p>"They ought to be all right," Quillan
said. "With that dope in them,
they'll be out cold for the next twelve
hours, and by that time, the boys from
Base will be here. Just leave 'em
alone and don't move 'em any more."</p>

<p>"Right. I'll call you back later.
Right now, Puss and I are going to
see what's wrong with the control
linkages on Number Two."</p>

<p>"Right. By-o."</p>

<p>De Hooch and Willows walked
back to the control room of Number
Two Reactor in silence.</p>

<p>Once inside the control room, de
Hooch said: "How are those control
circuits?" Willows was supposed to
have been checking them while he
had been dragging Ferguson and
Metty out of the antechamber.</p>

<p>"Well, I ... I'm not sure. I'll
show you what I've found so far, Guz.
You ought to take a look at them. I
... I'd like you to take a look-see. I
think"&mdash;he gestured toward the console&mdash;"I
think they're all right except
for the freezer vernier and the pressure
release control."</p>

<p><i>He doesn't trust his own work</i>, de
Hooch thought. <i>Well, that's all right.
Neither do I.</i></p>

<p>Painstakingly, the two of them
went over the checking circuits. Willows
was right. The freezer and pressure
controls were inoperable.</p>

<p>"Damn," said de Hooch. "Double
damn."</p>

<p>"They're probably both stuck at the
firewall," Willows said.</p>

<p>"Sure. Where else? I'll have to go
in there and unstick 'em. Help me
get back into that two-legged tank
again." He wished he knew more
about what Ferguson and Metty had
been doing. He wished he knew why
the two men had gone into the anteroom
in the first place. He wished a
lot of things, but wishing was a useless
pastime at this stage of the game.</p>

<p>If only one of the two men had
been in a condition to talk!</p>

<p>He got back into his radiation-proof
suit again, took one last look at
the instruments on the console, and
headed for the reactor.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Through the first radiation trap&mdash;left
turn, right turn, right turn, left
turn&mdash;through the "cold" room,
through the second radiation trap,
through the decontamination chamber,
and through the third radiation
trap into the anteroom. Now that
Ferguson and Metty were safely out
of the way, he could give his attention
to the damage that had been done.</p>

<p>Had Ferguson and Metty actually
come in to tap off a sample, as he had
suggested to Willows? He looked
around at the wreckage in the antechamber.
Quite obviously, the heavy
door of the sample chamber was wide
open, and it certainly appeared that
the wreckage was scattered from that
point. Cautiously, he went over to
look at the open sample chamber. It
looked all right, except that the bottom
was covered with a bright, metallic
dust. He rubbed his finger over it
and looked at the fingertip. A very
fine dust. And yet it hadn't been
scattered very much by the explosion.
Heavy. Very likely osmium. Osmium
187 was stable, but it wasn't a normally
used step toward Mercury 203.
Four successive alpha captures would
give Polonium 203, not mercury.
Ditto for an oxygen fusion. It could
be iridium or platinum, of course.
Whatever it was, the instruments in
his helmet told him it wasn't hot.</p>

<p>He had a hunch that Ferguson and
Metty had been building Mercury
203 from Hafnium 179 by the process
of successive fusions with Hydrogen
3 and that something had gone wrong
with the H-3 production. It appeared
that the explosion had been a simple
chemical blast caused by the air oxidation
of H-2. But the bleeder vent at
the other end of the reactor had apparently
kicked at the same time. An
enormous amount of unused energy
had been released, blowing the entire
emergency bleeder system out.</p>

<p>Something didn't seem right.
Something stuck in his craw, and he
couldn't figure out what it was.</p>

<p>He opened up the conduit boxes
that led through the antechamber
from the control console to the reactor
beyond the firewall. Everything
looked fine. That meant that whatever
it was that had fouled up the controls
was on the other side of the firewall.</p>

<p>"How does it look?" Willows'
voice came worriedly over the earphones.</p>

<p>"Have I already said 'damn'?" de
Hooch asked.</p>

<p>"You have," Willows said with
forced lightness. "You even said
'double damn'."</p>

<p>"<i>Factorial</i> damn, then!" said de
Hooch.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Apparently the foul-up is on the
<i>other</i> side of the firewall."</p>

<p>"Are you going in?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to."</p>

<p>"All right. Watch yourself."</p>

<p>"I will." He went over to the periscope
that surveyed the part of the
reactor beyond the firewall. Everything
looked normal enough. He
carefully checked the pressure gauge.
Normal.</p>

<p>"Check the spectro for me, will
you?" he asked. "Make sure that's just
the normal helium atmosphere in
there."</p>

<p>"Sure." A pause. "Nothing but
helium, Guz. What were you expecting?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd care to walk into
a hydrogen atmosphere at three hundred
Centigrade."</p>

<p>"Neither would I, but how could
there be hydrogen in there?"</p>

<p>"There shouldn't be. But there's
something screwy going on here, and
I can't put my finger on it."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it is, it isn't hydrogen
in the reactor room."</p>

<p>"O.K. Stand by. I'm going in."</p>

<p>He walked over to the firewall
door. On the other side of it was a
small chamber where the oxygen and
nitrogen of normal air would be
swept out before he opened the inner
door to go into the inner chamber itself.
There was no need for an air
lock, since small amounts of impurities
in the He-4 didn't bother anything.</p>

<p>It was just as he turned the lever
that undogged the firewall door that
he realized his mistake.</p>

<p>But it was too late.</p>

<p>The door jerked outward, and a hot
wind picked him up and slammed
him against the far wall.</p>

<p>There was a moment of pain.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;nothing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><i>There was something familiar about
the man who was turning the wheel,
but de Hooch couldn't place it. The
man was wearing a black hood, as befitted
a torturer and executioner.</i></p>

<p><i>"Idiot," said the hooded man, giving
the wheel of the rack a little more
pressure, "explain the following: If a
half plus a half is equal to a whole,
why is halfnium plus halfnium not
equal to wholmium?"</i></p>

<p><i>Stretched as he was on the rack, de
Hooch could not think straight because
of the excruciating pain.</i></p>

<p><i>"Because a half is eight point two
eight per cent heavier than a hole,"
said de Hooch.</i></p>

<p><i>"You are an idiot, none the less,"
said the torturer. He gave the wheel
another twist. De Hooch wanted to
scream, but he couldn't.</i></p>

<p><i>"Try again," said the torturer.
"What is a half plus four plus four
plus four plus four plus&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"Stop!" <i>screamed de Hooch</i>. "Stop!
<i>Stop at the osmium!</i>"</p>

<p><i>"Ah! But it</i> didn't <i>stop at the
osmium," said the hooded man. "It
went on and on and on. Plus four
plus four plus four plus four plus four&mdash;until
there were so many plus fours
in there that the place looked like an
old-fashioned golf course."</i></p>

<p><i>"My legs hurt," said de Hooch. The
man was no longer wearing a hood,
but de Hooch couldn't tell if it was
Willows or himself.</i></p>

<p><i>"We will all go together when we
go," said the man.</i></p>

<p><i>De Hooch turned his head away
and looked at the ceiling.</i></p>

<p>And he realized that it was the
ceiling of the antechamber.</p>

<p>"My legs hurt," he repeated. And
he could hear the hoarse whisper inside
the helmet. He realized that he
was lying flat on his back. He had
been jarred around quite a bit in the
suit.</p>

<p>He wondered if he could sit up. He
managed to get both arms behind
him and push himself into a sitting
position. He wiggled his feet. The
servos responded. He hurt all over,
but a little experiment told him that
he was only bruised. Nothing was
broken. He hadn't been hit as hard as
Ferguson and Metty had been.</p>

<p>"Willows?" he said. "Willows?"</p>

<p>There was no answer from the
earphones.</p>

<p>He looked at the chronometer dial
inside his helmet. Oh two forty-nine.
He had been unconscious less than
ten minutes.</p>

<p>The same glance brought his eyes
to two other dials. The internal radiation
of the suit was a little high, but
nothing to worry about. But the dial
registering the external radiation was
plenty high. Without the protection
of the suit, he wouldn't have lived
through those ten minutes.</p>

<p>Where was Willows?</p>

<p>And then he knew, and he pushed
any thought of further help from that
quarter out of his mind. What had to
be done would have to be done by
Peter de Hooch alone. He climbed to
his feet.</p>

<p>His head hurt, and he swayed with
nausea and pain. Only the massive
weight of the suit's shoes kept him
upright. Then it passed, and he
blinked his eyes and shook his head
to clear it. He found he was holding
his breath, and he let it out.</p>

<p>The trouble had been so simple,
and yet he hadn't seen it. Oh, yes, he
had! He <i>must</i> have, subconsciously.
Otherwise, how would he have
guessed that the stuff in the sampling
chamber was Osmium 187? Ferguson
and Metty <i>had</i> been trying to make
Mercury 203 by adding eight successive
tritium nuclei to Hafnium 179,
progressing through Tantalum 182,
Tungsten 185, Rhenium 188, Osmium
191, Iridium 194, Platinum
197, and Gold 200, all of which were
unstable.</p>

<p>But the Hydrogen 3 reaction had
gone wrong. The doubling had set in,
producing Helium 4. Successive additions
of the alpha particles to Hafnium
179 had produced, first, Tungsten
183, and then Osmium 187,
both of which were stable.</p>

<p>Ferguson and Metty, seeing that
something was wrong, drew off a sample
and then reset the reaction to
produce the Hg-203 they wanted.
Then they had come down to pick
up the sample.</p>

<p>They hadn't realized that the helium
production had gone wild. Much
more helium than necessary was being
produced, and the bleeder valve
had failed. When they opened the
sample chamber, they got a blast of
high-pressure helium right in the
face. The shock of that sudden release
had jarred the whole atmosphere
inside the reaction chamber, and the
bleeder valve had let go. But the violence
of the pressure release had
caused a fault to the surface to open
up and had closed the valve again&mdash;jammed
it, probably. There had been
enough pressure left in there to blow
de Hooch up against the nearest wall
when he opened the door. Since the
pressure indicator system was connected
to the release system, when
one had failed, the other had failed.
That's why the pressure gauge had indicated
normal.</p>

<p>And, of course, it had been the
pressure differential that had caused
the controls to stick. Well, they ought
to be all right now, then. He decided
he'd better take a look.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The firewall door was still open.
He walked over to it and stepped into
the small chamber that led to the
inner reactor room. The inside door,
much weaker than the outer firewall
door, had been blown off its hinges.
He stepped past it and went on in.</p>

<p>What he saw made him jerk his
glance away from the periscope in his
helmet and check his radiation detectors
again. Not much change. Relief
swept over him as he looked back at
the reactor itself. The normally dead
black walls were glowing a dull red.
It was pure thermal heat, but it
shouldn't be doing that.</p>

<p>Moving quickly, he went over to
the place where the control cables
came in through the firewall. It took
him several minutes to assure himself
that they would function from the
control room now. There was nothing
more to do but get out of here and
get that reaction damped.</p>

<p>He went out again, closing the
firewall door behind him and dogging
it tight. There would be no more
helium production now.</p>

<p>He went through the radiation
trap to the decontamination chamber
to wash off whatever it was he had
picked up.</p>

<p>The decontamination room was a
mess.</p>

<p>De Hooch stared at the twisted
pipes and the stream of water that
gushed out of a cracked valve. The
blast had jarred everything loose.
Well, he could still scrub himself off.</p>

<p>Except that the scrubbers weren't
working.</p>

<p>He swore under his breath and
twisted the valve that was supposed
to dispense detergent. It did, thank
Heaven. He doused himself good
with it and then got under the flowing
water.</p>

<p>The radiation level remained exactly
where it was.</p>

<p>He walked over and pulled one of
the brushes off the defunct scrubber
and sudsed it up. It wasn't until he
started to use it that he got a good
look at his arms. He hadn't paid any
attention before.</p>

<p>He walked over to the mirror to
get a good look.</p>

<p>"You look magnificent," he told
his reflection acidly.</p>

<p>The radiation-proof armor looked
as though it had been chrome plated.</p>

<p>But de Hooch knew better than
that. He knew exactly what had happened.
He was nicely plated all over
with a film of mercury, which had
amalgamated itself with the metallic
surface of the suit. He was thoroughly
wet with the stuff and no amount of
water and detergent would take it off.</p>

<p>There was something wrong with
Number Two Reactor, all right. It
had leaked out some of the Mercury
203 that Ferguson and Metty had
been making.</p>

<p>He thought a minute. It hadn't
been leaking out just before he
opened the door in the firewall, because
Willows would certainly have
noticed the bright mercury line when
he checked with the spectroscope.
The stuff must have been released
when the pressure dropped.</p>

<p>He walked back to the anteroom
and looked at the sampling chamber.
There were a few droplets of mercury
around the inlet.</p>

<p>Thus far, the three pressure explosions
had wrecked about everything
that was wreckable, he thought. No,
not quite. There was still the chance
that the whole station would go if he
didn't get back into the control room
and stop that "powers of two" chain.
The detonation of Instantanium 512
would finish the job by doing what
high-pressure helium could never do.</p>

<p>He glanced at the thermometer.
The temperature behind the firewall
had risen to two-forty Centigrade. It
wasn't supposed to be above two hundred.
It wasn't too serious, really, because
a little heat like that wouldn't
bother a Ditmars-Horst reactor, but it
indicated that things back there weren't
working properly.</p>

<p>He turned away and walked back
to the decontamination chamber.
There must be some way he could get
the mercury off the suit&mdash;because he
couldn't take the suit off until the
mercury was gone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap">First, he tried scrubbing. That was
what showed him how upset he really
was. He had actually scrubbed the
armor on his left arm free of mercury
when he realized what he was doing
and threw the brush down in disgust.</p>

<p>"Use your head, de Hooch!" he
told himself. What good would it do
to scrub the stuff off of the few
places he could reach? In the bulky
armor, he was worse than muscle-bound.
He couldn't touch any part of
his back; he couldn't bend far enough
to touch his legs. His shoulders were
inaccessible, even. Scrubbing was
worse than useless&mdash;it was time-wasting.</p>

<p>He picked up the brush again and
began scrubbing at the other arm. It
gave him something to do while he
thought. While he was thinking, he
wasn't wasting time.</p>

<p>What would dissolve mercury? Nitric
acid. Good old HNO<sub>3</sub>. Fine. Except
that the hot lab was at the other
end of the reactor, where the fissure
had let all the air out. The bulkheads
had dropped, and he couldn't get in.
And, naturally, the nitric acid would
be in the lab.</p>

<p>For the first time, he found himself
hating Willows' guts. If he were
around, he could get some acid from
the cold lab, or even from the other
hot lab at Number One. If Willows&mdash;</p>

<p>He stood up and dropped the
brush. "Dolt! Boob! Moron! Idiot!"
Not Willows. Himself. There was no
reason on earth&mdash;or Luna&mdash;why he
couldn't walk over to Number One
hot lab and get the stuff himself. The
habit of never leaving the lab without
thorough decontamination was so
thoroughly ingrained in him that he
had simply never thought about it
until that moment. But what did a little
contamination with radioactive
mercury mean at a time like this? He
could take F corridor to Number
One, use the decontamination chamber
and the acid from the lab, shuck
off his armor there, and come back
through E corridor. F could be cleaned
up later.</p>

<p>So simple.</p>

<p>He went through the light trap to
the next chamber and turned the
handle on the sliding door. The door
wouldn't budge. It had been warped
by the force of the helium blast, and it
was stuck in its grooves.</p>

<p>Well, there were tools. The thing
could be unstuck.</p>

<p>Peter de Hooch was a determined
man, a strong man, and a smart man.
But the door was more determined
and stronger than he was, and his intelligence
didn't give him much of an
edge right then. After an hour's hard
work, he managed to get the door
open about eighteen inches. Then it
froze fast and refused to move again.
All the power and leverage he could
bring to bear was useless. The door
had opened all it was going to open.
Beyond it, he could see the next radiation
trap&mdash;and freedom.</p>

<p>Eighteen inches would have been
plenty of space for him to get through
if he had not been wearing the radiation-proof
suit. But he didn't dare
take that suit off. By the time he got
out of the suit, the intensely radioactive
mercury on its surface would
have made his death only a matter of
time. And not much time at that.</p>

<p>He told himself that if it were simply
a matter of running to the control
room to shut off the D-H reactor, he'd
do it. That could have been done before
he lost consciousness. But it
wasn't that easy. Damping the reaction
took time and control. The stuff
had to be eased back slowly. Shutting
off the Ditmars-Horst would simply
blow a hole in the crust of Luna and
kill everyone if he did it now. There
were four or five men out there who
would die if he pulled anything foolish
like that. The explosion wouldn't
be as powerful as the Instantanium
512 reaction would be, but it would
be none the less deadly for all that.</p>

<p>There had to be either a way to
scrape the mercury off the suit or a
way to open the door another six
inches.</p>

<p>Or, he added suddenly, a way to get
safely out of the suit.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>At the end of another twenty minutes,
he had still thought of nothing.
He wandered around the decontamination
room, looking at everything,
hoping he might see something that
would give him a clue. He didn't.</p>

<p>He went into the antechamber of
the reactor and glared at the door in
the firewall. The instruments said
that things were getting pretty fierce
on the other side of that wall. Temperature:
Two ninety-five and still
rising. Pressure? He carefully cracked
the inlet of the sampling chamber
and got a soft hiss. The helium was
expanding from the heat, that was all.
Part of the trouble with the reactor,
he thought, was the high percentage
of oxygen and nitrogen that had
mixed in during the ten minutes or
so that the door was open. All hell
was fixing to bust loose in there, and
he, Peter de Hooch, was right next to
it.</p>

<p>He walked back into the decontamination
chamber.</p>

<p>What would dissolve mercury?</p>

<p>Mercury would dissolve gold.
Would gold dissolve mercury?</p>

<p>Very funny.</p>

<p>He was like a turtle, de Hooch
thought. Perfectly safe as long as he
was in his shell, but take him out of
it and he would die.</p>

<p><i>Hell of a way to spend the night</i>,
he thought. <i>A night in shining armor.</i></p>

<p>That struck him as funny. He began
to laugh. And laugh.</p>

<p>He almost laughed himself sick
before he realized that it was fear and
despair that were driving him into
hysteria, not a sense of humor. He
forced himself to calmness.</p>

<p>He must be calm.</p>

<p>He must think.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>How do you go about getting rid
of a radioactive metal that is in effect
welded to the outside of your
suit?</p>

<p>The trouble was, he was a nucleonics
engineer, not a chemist. He remembered
quite a bit of his chemistry,
of course, but not as much as he
would have liked.</p>

<p>Could the stuff be neutralized?</p>

<p>Sure, he told himself. Very simple.
All he had to do was go climb into
the reactor, and let the reactor do the
job. Mercury 203 plus an alpha particle
gives nice, stable Lead 207.
Just go climb right into the Ditmars-Horst
and let the Helium 4 do the
job.</p>

<p>But the thought stuck in his mind.</p>

<p>He kept telling himself not to panic
as Willows had done.</p>

<p>And several minutes later, chuckling
to himself in a half demented
fashion, he opened the firewall door
and went in to let the helium do the
job.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>It was nearly eight in the morning,
Greenwich time, when the three surface
vehicles, with their wide Caterpillar
treads lumbered to a halt near
the kiosk that marked the entrance to
the underground site of the laboratories.</p>

<p>"O.K.," said one of the men in the
first machine, holding a microphone
to his lips, "let's go in. If what Willows
said is true, the whole place may
blow any minute now, but I'm not
asking for volunteers. Nobody will be
any safer up here than they will down
there, and we have to do a job. Besides,
Willows wasn't completely rational.
Nobody would put on a vac
suit and run away like that if he was
in his right mind. So we can discount
a lot of what he said when we picked
him up on the road.</p>

<p>"The five of us in this car are going
straight to Number One Reactor to
see what can be done to stop whatever
is going on. The rest of you start
trying to see if you can get those
trapped men out of A and B corridors.
All right, let's move in."</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later, five
men went into the control room of
Number One Reactor. They found
Peter de Hooch sound asleep in the
control chair, and the instruments
showed that the Ditmars-Horst reactor
was inactive.</p>

<p>One of the men shook de Hooch
gently, awakening him in the middle
of a snore.</p>

<p>"What?" he said groggily.</p>

<p>"We're here, Guz. Everything's
O.K."</p>

<p>"Sure everything's O.K. Nothing to
it. All I did was wait until the temperature
got above three fifty-seven
Centigrade&mdash;above the boiling point
of mercury. Then I went in and let
the hot helium <i>boil</i> the stuff off me.
Nothing to it. Near boiled myself
alive, but it did the trick."</p>

<p>"What," asked the man in a puzzled
voice, "are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I am a knight in dull armor," said
Peter de Hooch, dozing off again.</p>

<p>Then he roused himself a little, and
said, without opening his eyes: "Hi
yo, Quicksilver, away." And he was
sound asleep again.</p>
